        <h2 class="Header-H2">Air Quality</h2>
        <p class="PDEF1">
            <span class="SP1">Air Quality</span> refers to the condition of the air within our surroundings, specifically with respect to the presence of pollutants and other harmful substances. It is determined by the concentration of various pollutants in the air, such as particulate matter, ozone, nitrogen dioxide, sulfur dioxide, and carbon monoxide. Poor air quality can have adverse effects on human health, the environment, and the economy. Monitoring and maintaining good air quality are essential for ensuring the well-being of both humans and the ecosystem.
